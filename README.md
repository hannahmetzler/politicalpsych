Abstract: Algorithms on digital media are thought to facilitate the spreading of hate speech, extremist and populist content, and fake news. It is widely assumed that they increase polarization by creating filter bubbles of like-minded people and increasing radicalization, with overall detrimental effects on democracy. Yet, algorithmic mechanisms on digital media are powered by social drivers, such as the need to identify with social or political groups and status competition between these groups. The interaction of social drivers and algorithms creates a feedback loop that complicates research that tries to disentangle the role of algorithms and already existing social phenomena. We present an overview of the current evidence on how algorithms affect misinformation and polarization, which suggests that social drivers play a major role and that the effects of algorithms are far from straightforward. Overall, algorithms seem to mostly reinforce existing social drivers, which stresses the importance of reflecting on digital media in the larger societal context, including individualism, populist politics, and climate change. We present concrete ideas and research questions to improve algorithms on digital platforms and to investigate their role in current problems and potential solutions.
